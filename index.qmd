Welcome! I’m Andrew.

My work focuses on natural resource management. From forestry to ocean conservation and food systems, I use data-informed decision-making to support ecosystems, the climate, and the communities I work with.

My technical skill set includes geomatics (GIS, remote sensing, and data analysis), project management, and collaborative communication.
